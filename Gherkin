Given I am on the "Add New Recipe" page

When I enter "Pasta Carbonara" in the title field

And I enter "Spaghetti, Eggs, Pancetta" in the ingredients field

And I enter "Boil pasta, Cook pancetta..." in the instructions field

And I click the "Save Recipe" button

Then I should see "Pasta Carbonara" in my list of recipes

And the recipe details should match what I entered.
